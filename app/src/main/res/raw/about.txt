Breast cancer is a malignant tumor which started from the cells in the breast area. It occurs mostly in females, but can also affect men. It is the most common cancer in females. Breast cancer can either be invasive or non-invasive. For invasive breast cancer, the cancer cells break out and invade the nearby tissue. While for the non-invasive breast cancer, the cancer cells stay in its place of origin, but can also develop into invasive breast cancer.
